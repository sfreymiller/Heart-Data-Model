# Heart Disease Model

I explored linear and logistic regression models for this heart disease dataset, and the logistic regression model attained an f-1 score of .79. Some of the most important features in predicting heart disease appear to be the presence of heart pain and the state of ST depression after exercise. I would like to return to this dataset to attempt a random forest model and to explore feature engineering with several of the non-binary categorical variables.
